# Game of Thrones Tapestry

This project was created originally for my CSCI 497 class, but quickly became a passion project as I spent an obscene amount of time creating a completely function and (relatively) correct map of the Game of Thrones universe. The map I used was the concept map for the show adaptation, which in the end isn't the 'canon' map, but who cares! Definitely not me... ðŸ˜…

## Concepts

This project combines 3 core skills: Sewing, Electrical circuitry, and Arduino programming with C++
I am no good at sewing, and electrical circuitry is more of a passion than a profession, but in the end a working tapestry was made!
