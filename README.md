# Game of Thrones Tapestry

This project was created originally for my CSCI 497 class, but quickly became a passion project as I spent an obscene amount of time creating a completely function and (relatively) correct map of the Game of Thrones universe. The map I used was the concept map for the show adaptation, which in the end isn't the 'canon' map, but who cares! Definitely not me... ~~I will never forgive you David Benioff and D.B. weiss~~ ðŸ˜…ðŸ‘€

## Concepts

This project combines 3 core skills: Sewing, Electrical circuitry, and 2 Arduino's C++ programming.
I am no good at sewing, and electrical circuitry is more of a personal passion than my profession, but in the end a working tapestry was made! By combining actuators and sensors along the various pins available on my both my first Arduino board (Lilypad Protosnap Plus) and my second board (FLORA) allowed for one of the most complex project I have completed.
