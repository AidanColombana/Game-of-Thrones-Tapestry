# Game of Thrones Tapestry 

## Background

This project was created originally for my CSCI 497 class, but quickly became a passion project as I spent an obscene amount of time creating a completely function and (relatively) to scale map of the Game of Thrones universe. The map I used was the concept map for the show adaptation's later seasons, which in the end isn't the 'canon' map, or even makes sense in universe, but who cares! Definitely not me... ~~I will never forgive you David Benioff and D.B. Weiss~~ ðŸ˜…

## Concepts

This project combines 3 core skills: Sewing, Electrical circuitry, and 2 Arduino's C++ programming.
I am no good at sewing, and electrical circuitry is more of a personal passion than my profession, but in the end a working tapestry was made! By combining actuators and sensors along the various pins available on my both my first Arduino board (Lilypad Protosnap Plus) and my second board (FLORA) allowed for one of the most complex project I have completed.

## Implementation

### Background
The map itself is created on a black background tapestry which acts as the 'motherboard' of the project. This is because every piece of electronics on the tapestry is connected using conductive thread, and if ANY of them touch, it will short the arduino and turn off for safety reasons. This means the electrical thread is (for the most part) extremely organized, well spaced, and definitely did not make me almost rage quit the project.
